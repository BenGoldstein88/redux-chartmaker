<h1> Chartmaker </h1>

This is a tool for musicians (or whomever, really) to build, edit, view, and transpose charts. Save functionality is forthcoming, so be patient.

<h2> First: </h2>

Choose your key. Do this from the circle on the top left of the screen.

Your starting key is important, as it will serve as reference if/when you decide to transpose the chart.

<h2> Next: </h2>
(in no particular order)

Enter the chart information at the top. This includes the names of the song, composer, and arranger (that's you!).

Click **ADD SECTION** (or keyboard shortcut 'shift-enter') to create a blank section of name 'Chorus'. You can do this again at any time from 'Edit' mode.

<h2> So You've Got Some Sections </h2>

Now what? Add some measures, my person, by clicking the **ADD MEASURE** button. You can also move the section Up/Down or remove it entirely from the section toolbar.

Each measure comes default with 4 beats. Sorry non-duple metres – you're not supported yet (also forthcoming, worry not). Each beat has room for a chord. Click a beat to edit its contents. You can navigate through beats in a measure/section with the arrow keys and tab. Hit enter when you're done entering chords.

<h2> My chart is pretty much built, I think. What's next? </h2>

Check your details, amigo. There's a multiplier option for each section if it repeats. Make sure your section names are accurate – ex. Verse 1, Verse (Instrumental), Intro, Outro, Coda, Bridge, Chorus, Interlude, Jam, Breakdown, etc.

You can toggle between **SHOW** and **EDIT** modes with a button in the top right, or with keyboard-shortcut '`'. Show mode is  a work in progress, but it is meant to remove extraneous material from the chart for printing/saving/use-offline.

<h2> You Mentioned Transposition? </h2>

Yes! Once you have chords in the beat-boxes, selecting a new key from the top-left key-menu will automatically transpose your entire chart to the newly selected key. 17 different keys are currently supported. Chartmaker will automatically capitalize the first letter input to a beat-box, but make sure you use valid roots if you want the transposition to work! ex. C7/e would wrongly go to D7/e, whereas C7/E would correctly go to D7/F#.

<h2> Anything else? </h2>

I've mentioned that saving and non-duple metre support is forthcoming, and it is. So there's that.

You needn't hit 'Enter' to change a chord, it will automatically become whatever you have input with your keyboard.

If you're having trouble removing a chord, try inputting ' ' (a blank space) before pressing Left/Right/Up/Down/Enter/Tab or clicking away.

Measure can be deleted with the **X** button beneath each one. That should be obvious, but here it is mentioned explicitly.

There are some keyboard shortcuts!

Shift-Enter: 	Add new section
`: 				Toggle EDIT/SHOW mode
ArrowKeys:		Move between beats while one is selected,
					Move between chart information (name, composer, arranger) when one is selected
Tab:			Move to the first beat of the next measure when a beat is selected
					Move to the next piece of chart information if one is selected
